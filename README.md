# Overview

This project focuses on the analysis of a faux car sales dataset for a referenced company obtained from [kaggle.com](kaggle.com). The dataset provides information about various car models, their years, prices, and quantities sold. The purpose of this software is to analyze the dataset and extract insights regarding average car prices, sales by year, revenue, and additional analysis tasks.
